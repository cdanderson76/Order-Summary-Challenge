With this project, I was made aware of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).  If I only would have taken a look at my design files, I would have known that this 'curved' background, which I had so much trouble figuring out how to create, was there for me to use.  I guess that's good because I used Figma to create that curve and used it in my design.  It's not perfect, but it looks pretty ok.  I tried minimizing my code in CSS as much as I possibly could, but it got to the point to where I didn't know what else to adjust.  If anyone has any pointers, feel free to let me know!  Thanks everyone...
